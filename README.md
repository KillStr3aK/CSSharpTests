# CSSharpTests
This plugin servers as a playground for trying out (new/experimental) things.

Also it might come handy for people to see how could they achieve/implement such things.

# Tests
- [BasicTests](https://github.com/KillStr3aK/CSSharpTests/blob/master/Tests/BasicTests.cs)
  - These are common and relatively stable tests, mostly aimed at the testing the API stuff to make sure everything works correctly

- [ExperimentalTests](https://github.com/KillStr3aK/CSSharpTests/blob/master/Tests/ExperimentalTests.cs)
  - These are experimental and unstable tests, mostly aimed at fixing things or finding workarounds for something 
  - [Models/Experimental](https://github.com/KillStr3aK/CSSharpTests/tree/master/Models/Experimental) Contains experimental implementations that may result in crashes.
